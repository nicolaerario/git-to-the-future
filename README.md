# Rewrite your history with git

This repository is a short collection of exercises useful for history _"manipulation"_ in GIT.

- It's in `template` format, so each `branch` stands on its own, having its own history;
- Each branch represents an exercise, ordered by increasing difficulty;
- Each exercise has its own instructions to follow;
- You'll not need to push the code to complete the exercises.

To get started (after clicking on **"Use this template -> Create a new repository"**):

```
git switch <branch-name>
```

for example:

```
git switch exercise-1
```

to go to the exercise;  
follow the instructions in the README inside the branch;

If, for any reason, you get stuck or break something you can return to the original state with:

```
git reset --hard <origin/branch-name>
```
